[![Badge Chrome]][Chrome]

## 📣 Toggl Button is now the Toggl Track browser extension!
We not only renamed the extension, but we also made several changes to Track Extension's codebase to build a better foundation for the future and make it easier to contribute new integrations.

For more information, please check this [blogpost](https://toggl.com/blog/purposeful-open-source).

This is the repo for the browser extension's integrations.

Start and stop the timer from the web tools you use daily. Get the time-tracking
out of the way and focus on real work.
