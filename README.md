# Toggl Track browser extension integrations

## ðŸ“£ Toggl Button is now the Toggl Track browser extension!
We not only renamed the extension, but we also made several changes to Track Extension's codebase to build a better foundation for the future and make it easier to contribute new integrations.

For more information, please check this [blogpost](https://toggl.com/blog/purposeful-open-source).
